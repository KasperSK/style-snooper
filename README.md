# style-snooper

A simple tool to extract the WPF styles for `FrameworkElement`s.

These can provide a useful starting point to your own customisations.

This repo derives from code source from [Eli Arbel](https://arbel.net/2006/11/05/revamped-style-snooper/),
though the original source may have been [Walt Tirscher](https://wpfwonderland.wordpress.com/2007/01/02/wpf-tools-stylesnooper/).
These various projects were hosted on blogs which have since yielded broken links to downloads and such.
Hopefully this repo lasts as long as WPF developers do.

This repo includes some minor stylistic and cosmetic changes.
